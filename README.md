# Project Directory Website Profile

This is a webpage that uses Flask and SQLAlchemy. The site has a detail page, about, and edit page for extra functionality.
The site contains my portfolio which includes projects worked in class with one custom program I wrote that could be used
in IT Offensive Security. The detail page populates with the correct field for that specific project. I really enjoyed this project and learned
how to use programming interactively with a webpage. Links have been added to all my certifications and resume.

To use the program, navigate to the directory of your choosing and run this command: git clone https://github.com/mitchredd77/project_directory.git  

Then create a virtual environment and activate it. Upon activating, install the required dependencies by runniing this command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Then you would type run the app.py file: python3 app.py
