# project_directory

This is a webpage that uses Flask and SQLAlchemy. The site has a detail page, about, and edit page for extra functionality.
The site contains my portfolio which includes projects worked in class with one custom program I wrote that could be used
in IT Offensive Security. The detail page populates with the correct field for that specific project. I really enjoyed this project and learned
how to use programming interactively with a webpage. Links have been added to all my certifications and resume.
